The output is wrong because the 'hashCode' method of Employee class
generate the hash from all attributes which include 'visited' field.

But when adding item into the 'tracker' hash map,
the program changes the value of the 'visited' field of the item inside the 'tracker' hash map.
This action changes the hash of the item inside the 'tracker' hash map.

Therefore, when the program check if an item is contained in the 'tracker' hash map or not,
it might find that the hash of checking item is different from the hash of all items in the 'tracker' hash map.
Then that duplicated item will not be removed from the original list.
