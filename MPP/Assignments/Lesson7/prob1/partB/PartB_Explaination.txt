The output is wrong because the 'equals' method of the Employee class doesn't override the 'equals' method of Object class.
Therefore, the 'contains' method of the ArrayList will call the 'equals' method of the Object class instead of
the 'equals' method of the Employee class.
But the 'equals' method of the Object class will compare the object addresses instead of the Employee attributes.
That causes the 'contains' method of the ArrayList always return false.
So the program cannot find any item in the 'answer' list that is also in the 'dupsRemoved' list.
That's why the 'listsAreEqual' method returns the result that 2 lists are different.
