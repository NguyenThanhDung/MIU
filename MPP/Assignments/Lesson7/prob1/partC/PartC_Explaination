The output is wrong because the 'Employee' class doesn't implement 'hashCode' method
which should generate hash from the 'name' and 'salary' fields of the 'Employee' class.
So when putting 'Employee' object to the 'tracker' hash map
or checking if an 'Employee' object was contained in the 'tracker' hashmap or not,
the result is not correct.
Therefore, the program cannot remove duplicated items from original list.
